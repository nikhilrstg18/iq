## How to solve coding problems

How to Tackle Coding Interview with 15 steps

1. When the interviewer says the question; **Write down key points on the top (sorted, array, etc.)**
   1. Make sure you have all the details.
   2. Show how organized you are.
2. **Double check**: 
   1. What are the inputs? 
   2. What are the outputs?
3. What is most important **value of the problem**? 
   1. What you want to focus on **time** or **space**. 
   2. What is the main goal?
4. Don't be annoying asking too many questions.
5. **Start with naive/brute force approach.**
   1. First thing that comes into your mind
   2. It that you are able to thinks well and critically 
   3. You don't even need to write the code, just speak about it.
6. **Tell them why your first approach is not the best** (i.e. O(n2) or higher, readability, etc.)
7.  **Walk-through your approach, comment things and see where you may be able to break things**
    1.  Any Repeatetion, bottleneck(s) or any unnecessary work done?
8.  **Before you start coding walk through your code, write down the steps that you're going to do** 
    1.  Tip: create a recipe before actually dive into cooking
9.  **Modularize your code from the very beginning.**
    1.  Break down your code into very small bits and pieces
    2.  Just add comments if you need to 
10. Start actually writing your code now.
    1.  Keep in mind that the more you prepare and what you need to code, the better the whiteboard.
    2.  So never start a white board interview not being sure how things are going to workout  
11. **Think about the error checks and how you can break this code**
    1.  Never make assumptions about inputs.
    2.  Assume people are trying to break your code
    3.  How will you safeguard it?
    4.  Tip: Always check false input that you don't want. 
12. **Don't use Bad/Confusing names like i, j, map, etc**.
    1.  Write code that reads well.
13. **Test your code**: 
    1.  Check for no params, 0, undefined, null, massive arrays, async code, etc.
14. Finally talk to the interviewer, where you would improve the code.
    1.  Does it work ?
    2.  Is it readable ?
    3.  Are there different approaches ?
15. If you interviewer is happy with your code, interview usually ends here. It's common that interviewer usually asks extension questions, like 
    a. How will you handle the problem if the whole input is too large to fit into memory? Start talking about the Space Complexity

❓ *Do I need to go through this kind of analysis to solve problem in everyday life ?*

- **No**, above points demonstrate the thought process the good developers have, and what companies are looking for.

- If You are able to think clearly thru aforesaid steps and you are able to solve problems this way, You'll see how impressive is this instead of just writing the solution

- Even if by end of time, you are not able to solve the problem. You have demonstrated the ability to think like an engineer to you interviewer and these are the skills which are rare and companies like to hire for
