1. ### What is .Net Core

   The [.NET Core](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) platform is a new .NET stack that is optimized for open source development and agile delivery on NuGet.

   .NET Core has two major components. It includes a small runtime that is built from the same codebase as the .NET Framework CLR. The .NET Core runtime includes the same **GC** and **JIT** (RyuJIT), but doesn‚Äôt include features like Application Domains or Code Access Security. The runtime is delivered via NuGet, as part of the ASP.NET Core package.

   .NET Core also includes the base class libraries **(BCL)**. These libraries are largely the same code as the .NET Framework class libraries, but have been factored (removal of dependencies) to enable to ship a smaller set of libraries. These libraries are shipped as `System.*` NuGet packages on [nuget.org](https://www.nuget.org/)

2. ### What is MSIL

   When we compile our .NET code then it is not directly converted to native/binary code; it is first converted into intermediate code known as MSIL code which is then interpreted by the CLR. MSIL is independent of hardware and the operating system. Cross language relationships are possible since MSIL is the same for all .NET languages. MSIL is further converted into native code.
